## Why You Should Read This Article

- Clear commit content -> reviewers will be very happy -> love for team members -> brotherly bonds strengthen ðŸ‘Œ

## General Structure of a Commit Message

Where:

- `type` and `description` are **REQUIRED**
- `body` is **OPTIONAL** and may or may not be included

### `<type>`

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **chore**: Updates to dependencies that do not relate to bug fixes or new features, and do not change the source code
- **refactor**: Renaming functions or variables for clarity, splitting functions, removing redundant code, etc. (these changes do not aim to fix bugs or add features)
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **style**: Code formatting updates, such as adding/removing whitespace, deleting extra blank lines, etc.
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding missing test cases, fixing unit tests, etc.
- **build**: Changes affecting the build process or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files or scripts
- **revert**: Reverting to a previous commit

### `<description>`

- A **brief description** of the commit content
- Should be **no longer than 50 characters** for easy readability on GitHub and other git tools
- Use an **imperative mood**, in the **present tense**. For example: **â€œchange ...â€œ instead of â€œchanged ...â€œ**
- **Do not capitalize the first letter**
- **Do not use a period at the end of the sentence**

### `[body]`

- This is an **OPTIONAL** section used to provide a **more detailed description** of the commit if needed
- Separate this part from `<type>: <description>` with a **blank line**
- Use it to explain the questions of **What (to do)** or **Why (why it's needed)**, but NOT How (how to do it)
