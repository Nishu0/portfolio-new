## The Unexpected Introduction

It all started with a casual conversation with a friend who threw me an interesting challenge: "Why don't you try building an HTTP server in Zig without any external libraries?" As someone comfortable with TypeScript/JavaScript backends, this piqued my interest. The idea of building something from scratch in a systems programming language was both intimidating and exciting.

## What is Zig?

Zig is a modern systems programming language that aims to be a better C. Created by Andrew Kelley in 2016, it focuses on maintaining simplicity while providing powerful features.

## Why Zig?

Here's what makes Zig special:

### 1. No Hidden Control Flow

#### What does this mean?

In many languages, there are operations that secretly do more than what you see in the code. Zig makes everything explicit - what you see is what you get.

#### Comparison with Other Languages:

**TypeScript Example (Hidden Control Flow)**:

```typescript
// This innocent-looking code can throw exceptions you might not expect
const value = array[0] // Could throw if array is empty
const result = JSON.parse(data) // Could throw parsing error
```

**Rust Example (Hidden Control Flow)**:

```rust
// The `?` operator secretly returns from the function on error
fn get_data() -> Result {
    let file = File::open("data.txt")?;  // Hidden return on error
    let content = file.read_to_string()?; // Hidden return on error
    Ok(content)
}
```

**Zig Example (Explicit Control Flow)**:

```zig
// Errors must be handled explicitly with 'try' or 'catch'
fn getData() ![]u8 {
    var file = try std.fs.openFile("data.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();
    var content = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, max_size);
    return content;
}
```

### 2. No Hidden Memory Allocations

#### What does this mean?

In Zig, when code needs to allocate memory, it must do so explicitly. This makes it easier to understand performance characteristics and prevent memory leaks.

#### Comparison:

**TypeScript Example (Hidden Allocations)**:

```typescript
// Many hidden allocations happening here
const arr = []
arr.push(1) // Array might reallocate
const str = "Hello " + name // Creates new string allocation
```

**Rust Example (Semi-Hidden Allocations)**:

```rust
// Vec and String allocate memory behind the scenes
let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(1);  // Might reallocate
let s = String::from("hello");  // Allocates memory
```

**Zig Example (Explicit Allocations)**:

```zig
// All allocations are explicit
var list = std.ArrayList(i32).init(allocator);
defer list.deinit();
try list.append(1);  // Must provide allocator explicitly
```

### 3. Compile-time Features

#### What does this mean?

Zig can run code during compilation, which helps catch errors early and generate optimized code.

#### Comparison:

**TypeScript Example**:

```typescript
// Type checking happens at compile time, but no real code execution
type Vector = [number, number]
const v: Vector = [1, 2]
```

**Rust Example**:

```rust
// Const evaluation is possible but limited
const ARRAY: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
const SUM: i32 = ARRAY.iter().sum();  // Limited compile-time computation
```

**Zig Example**:

```zig
// Full code execution at compile time
const Point = struct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,

    // This runs during compilation
    pub fn origin() Point {
        return Point{ .x = 0, .y = 0 };
    }
};

// Compute values at compile time with comptime
comptime {
    const p = Point.origin();
    @compileError(if (p.x != 0) "Invalid origin" else "");
}
```

### 4. C Interoperability

#### What does this mean?

Zig can use C code directly without any special bindings or wrappers.

#### Comparison:

**TypeScript Example**:

```typescript
// Needs complex bindings like node-ffi or WebAssembly
const ffi = require("ffi-napi")
const lib = ffi.Library("libc", {
  printf: ["int", ["string"]],
})
```

**Rust Example**:

```rust
// Needs extern blocks and unsafe
#[link(name = "c")]
extern "C" {
    fn printf(format: *const c_char, ...) -> c_int;
}
```

**Zig Example**:

```zig
// Direct C integration
const c = @cImport({
    @cInclude("stdio.h");
});

pub fn main() void {
    _ = c.printf("Hello %s\n", "world");
}
```

## Summary: Why Choose Zig?

1. **Predictability**: Everything is explicit - no surprises in control flow or memory allocation
2. **Learning Curve**: While it's a systems language, its simplicity makes it easier to learn than Rust
3. **Performance**: Direct control over memory and computation without hidden costs
4. **Safety**: Compile-time checks catch many errors before your code runs
5. **Versatility**: Great for both high-level application code and low-level systems programming

## Best Used For:

- Systems programming
- Performance-critical applications
- Embedded systems
- Projects that need C interoperability
- Learning about low-level programming concepts

Coming from TypeScript, Zig might feel more verbose at first, but this verbosity brings clarity and control. Coming from Rust, you'll find Zig simpler but with fewer guardrails - it trusts you more but expects you to be more careful.

You can read the official documentation [here](https://ziglang.org/learn/why_zig_rust_d_cpp/).

## Setting Up ZigðŸ§©

Getting started with Zig is surprisingly straightforward. Here's how I set up my development environment:

First, download Zig from the official website (https://ziglang.org/download/)
Add Zig to your system's PATH
Verify the installation:

```zig
$ zig version
0.11.0
```

Hello, Zig!
Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" to understand Zig's basic syntax:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    try stdout.print("Hello, World!\n", .{});
}
```

Let's break this down:

- `const std = @import("std")` imports Zig's standard library
- `pub fn main()` declares our main function
- `!void` indicates the function can return an error or nothing
- `try` is used for error handling
- `.{}` is an empty tuple for format arguments

## Understanding Zig's Primitive Types

Before we dive into building our HTTP server, let's understand Zig's primitive types with some practical examples:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    std.debug.print("Hello, world!\n", .{});
    //Zig supports various forms of integers, floating point numbers, and pointers
    const x: i8 = -100; // Signed 8-bit integer
    const y: u8 = 120; // Unsigned 8-bit integer
    const z: f32 = 100.324; // 32-bit floating point

    std.debug.print("x={}\n", .{x}); // x=-100
    std.debug.print("y={}\n", .{y}); // y=120
    std.debug.print("z={d:3.2}\n", .{z}); // z=100.32

    //enum
    const Color = enum {
        red,
        green,
        blue,
    };
    const c: Color = Color.red;
    std.debug.print("c={}\n", .{c}); // c=red
    //Zig lets you override the ordinal values of enums as follows:
    const LogType = enum(u32) { info = 200, err = 500, warn = 600 };
    const log_type: LogType = LogType.info;
    std.debug.print("log_type={}\n", .{log_type});

    //Arrays
    const vowels = [5]u8{ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{vowels}); // aeiou
    std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{vowels.len}); // 5

    // Extended syntax for arrays
    // we can omit the size since itâ€™s known at compile time and that's why we can use the _ symbol
    const numbers = [_]i32{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{numbers}); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    //Slices
    const testingNumber = [5]i32{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    const slice = testingNumber[0..2];
    std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{slice}); // [1, 2]

    // strings
    const name = "Nisarg Thakkar!";
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{name}); // Nisarg Thakkar!
    std.debug.print("{}\n", .{@TypeOf(name)}); // *const [15:0]u8
    std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{name.len}); // 15

    // Zig strings are immutable, so you canâ€™t change them after creation.
    // To modify a string, you need to convert it to a mutable array.
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;
    //std.heap.page_allocator is a general-purpose allocator in Zig that
    // manages memory using OS pages. It provides dynamic memory allocation,
    // meaning memory is requested at runtime instead of being statically defined.
    var mutable_name = try allocator.dupe(u8, name);
    // allocator.dupe(u8, name) duplicates (copies) the string name into newly
    // allocated memory. dupe takes a type and original slice, and returns
    // a new slice with the same contents.
    // The result (mutable_name) is now a mutable array of u8 with the same contents as name.
    defer allocator.free(mutable_name);
    // defer is used to ensure that the memory allocated by allocator.dupe
    // is freed when the mutable_name variable goes out of scope.
    mutable_name[0] = 'B';
    // mutable_name is now a mutable array of u8 with the same contents
    // as name, but with the first character changed to 'B'.
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{mutable_name}); // Bisarg Thakkar!

    // structs and unions
    const person = struct {
        name: []const u8,
        age: u8,
    };
    const p: person = person{ .name = "Nisarg", .age = 20 };
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{p.name}); // Nisarg

    //Zig unions are like structs,â€Šbut they can have only one active field at a time.
    const union_person = union(enum) {
        name: []const u8,
        age: u8,
    };
    const up: union_person = union_person{ .name = "Nisarg" };
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{up.name}); // Nisarg

    // Zig supports anonymous structs, which are structs without a name.
    const anonymous_person = struct {
        name: []const u8,
        age: u8,
    };
    const ap: anonymous_person = anonymous_person{ .name = "Nisarg", .age = 20 };
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{ap.name}); // Nisarg

    // control flow structures
    // Zig supports if, else if, else, and switch statements.
    const score: u8 = 100;

    if (score >= 90) {
        std.debug.print("Congrats!\n", .{});
        std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{"*" ** 10});
    } else if (score >= 50) {
        std.debug.print("Congrats!\n", .{});
    } else {
        std.debug.print("Try again...\n", .{});
    }

    // switch statements
    const marks: u8 = 88;

    switch (marks) {
        90...100 => {
            std.debug.print("Congrats!\n", .{});
            std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{"*" ** 10});
        },
        50...89 => {
            std.debug.print("Congrats!\n", .{});
        },
        else => {
            std.debug.print("Try again...\n", .{});
        },
    }

    //while statements
    var i: u8 = 0;
    while (i < 10) : (i += 1) {
        std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{i});
    }

    // for statements
    for (0..10) |_| {
        std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{i});
    }

    // for statements with break and continue
    for (0..10) |_| {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;
        }
        std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{i});
    }

    // for statements with continue
    for (0..10) |_| {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue;
        }
        std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{i});
    }

    // Zig supports the following compound assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
    var a: u8 = 10;
    a += 5;
    std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{a}); // 15

}

```

## Building an HTTP Server from Scratch

Now that we understand the basics, let's build something real: a simple HTTP server using Zig's native HTTP capabilities.

### Understanding Zig's Native HTTP Support

Zig provides built-in networking and HTTP functionality through its standard library. We'll use:

- `std.net` for network operations
- `std.http` for HTTP protocol handling

Here's our complete HTTP server implementation:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const net = std.net;
const http = std.http;

pub fn main() !void {
    const addr = net.Address.parseIp4("127.0.0.1", 9090) catch |err| {
        std.debug.print("An error occurred while resolving the IP address: {}\n", .{err});
        return;
    };

    var server = try addr.listen(.{});
    start_server(&server);
}

fn start_server(server: *net.Server) void {
    while(true) {
        var connection = server.accept() catch |err| {
            std.debug.print("Connection to client interrupted: {}\n", .{err});
            continue;
        };
        defer connection.stream.close();

        var read_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;
        var http_server = http.Server.init(connection, &read_buffer);

        var request = http_server.receiveHead() catch |err| {
            std.debug.print("Could not read head: {}\n", .{err});
            continue;
        };
        handle_request(&request) catch |err| {
            std.debug.print("Could not handle request: {}", .{err});
            continue;
        };
    }
}

fn handle_request(request: *http.Server.Request) !void {
    std.debug.print("Handling request for {s}\n", .{request.head.target});
    try request.respond("Hello http!\n", .{});
}
```

Let's break down the key components:

1. **Server Setup**:

   - We create a server listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) port 9090
   - `net.Address.parseIp4()` converts the IP and port into a network address
   - `addr.listen()` creates a listening socket

2. **Connection Handling** (`start_server` function):

   - Runs an infinite loop to accept connections
   - Uses `defer` to ensure connections are properly closed
   - Creates a buffer for reading HTTP requests
   - Initializes an HTTP server for each connection

3. **Request Handling** (`handle_request` function):
   - Processes incoming HTTP requests
   - Currently just responds with "Hello http!"
   - Logs the requested target path

## Conclusion

This journey into Zig has been kinda fun. From understanding its unique features to building a basic HTTP server, we've seen how Zig combines low-level control with high-level clarity. None of this would have been possible without Satyam ([@\_sk1122](https://x.com/_sk1122)) introducing me to Zig.
