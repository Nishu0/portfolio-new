Hello! I'm **Nisarg Thakkar**, a **Web3 Full Stack Developer** from Gujarat, India. I'm a Web3 Full Stack developer specializing in **Move smart contract** development. With a passion for hackathons and web app creation, I bring expertise in Move, **Next.js**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, **React**, and **Solidity** to build innovative blockchain solutions.

## More

I'm passionate about creating Web3 products that appear both accessible and easy to manage.

I'm a proactive and adaptable worker and learner who enjoys being a part of internationally remote teams where people are prioritized and values such as trust, kindness, and inclusiveness are valued. I'm always up for a challenge that will allow me to improve and broaden my skill set or participate in hackathon over the weekends.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime, playing video games with friends, and spending time with them or my family. I'm constantly listening to music, so check out the website footer to see what I'm listening to right now.

If you're interested in the hardware and software tools I use every day to help me get the job done, please visit the `usage` page.

## Contact

I adore my job and take much pleasure (and occasionally frustration) in every project I undertake. Please look at my portfolio.
